# Sqlite
A clean SQLite FFI binding for Pharo for those who only want to use SQLite easily without any overlayer.

# Acknowledgements
This project is a fork of the 'UDBC-SQLite-Base' package of [Pharo-UDBC](https://github.com/astares/Pharo-UDBC) project which itself seems to have forked part of the code of [Garage](https://github.com/pharo-rdbms/garage).

Wherever this code comes from originally, thanks to all the contributors who enhanced this project over time.
